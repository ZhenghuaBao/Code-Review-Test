# OrcaRouter Code Review

AI pull-request review powered by the [OrcaRouter](https://orcarouter.ai) model
gateway. A cheap model screens every push; once a push comes back clear of
serious (P0/P1) issues, a strong model makes the final pass. Findings post as
inline PR comments, tagged by severity, and a configurable gate can block the
merge.

## What it does

1. **Stateful cost-tiered cascade** — each PR stores its current tier as a
   `review-tier:1` label, both tiers routed through OrcaRouter. A PR starts on
   the cheap tier (no label). If the cheap model finds any **P0/P1**, those are
   serious — the PR stays on the cheap tier so you fix them first (no point
   paying for the strong tier while obvious bugs remain). When a cheap pass comes
   back with nothing worse than **P2**, the action **escalates to the strong
   model in the same run** (so the strong tier always reviews before merge) and
   records a **permanent promotion** via the label, so every later push goes
   straight to the strong model. The action names **no models**: it decides the
   tier and emits it as raw facts (`x-cr-prev-tier` / `x-cr-prev-p0p1`), which an
   in-job loopback proxy stamps as headers onto OCR's requests; the workspace
   **router's DSL recipe** maps those facts to the concrete cheap/strong model
   (see [`recipes/code-review.dsl.yaml`](./recipes/code-review.dsl.yaml) and
   [Configuration](#configuration)).
2. **Severity tagging** — every comment is prefixed `[P0]` / `[P1]` / `[P2]`
   (see rubric below). The tag mandate is layered onto OCR's built-in
   language/security review via `--background` (it adds to, never replaces,
   those checks) using `rules/severity-instruction.md`.
3. **Inline comments** — findings post on the exact lines of the PR.
4. **Merge gate** — the job fails if any **P0** is found; mark the check
   "required" in branch protection to block the merge.
5. **Per-commit loop** — `synchronize` re-reviews on every new push; comment
   `/orcarouter-review` on a PR to re-run on demand. The comment re-run posts
   fresh review comments but does **not** update the required merge-gate check:
   an `issue_comment` run is tied to the default branch, not the PR head, so its
   pass/fail can't attach to the PR's commit. Push a new commit to refresh the
   gate; use the comment command for an extra read, not to flip a red check
   green.

## Setup (3 steps)

1. **Create the router that owns model selection.** In the OrcaRouter dashboard
   (Routers → New), create a router named **`code-review`** in your workspace and
   paste [`recipes/code-review.dsl.yaml`](./recipes/code-review.dsl.yaml) as its
   DSL. This is where the cheap/strong models live — edit the recipe to change
   them; the action references it by alias (`orcarouter/code-review`) and names
   no models itself. (Routers are per-workspace, so this is a one-time manual
   step the API key can't do for you.)

2. Add this workflow at **`.github/workflows/orcarouter-code-review.yml`**
   (copy from [`workflows/orcarouter-code-review.yml`](./workflows/orcarouter-code-review.yml)):

   ```yaml
   name: OrcaRouter Code Review
   on:
     pull_request_target:
       types: [opened, synchronize]
     issue_comment:
       types: [created]
   permissions:
     contents: read
     pull-requests: write
     issues: write # label-based tier state + clean/fallback PR comments
   jobs:
     review:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       # PR events, or a `/orcarouter-review` command from a maintainer —
       # otherwise any commenter could spend your quota.
       if: |
         github.event_name == 'pull_request_target' ||
         (github.event_name == 'issue_comment' &&
           github.event.issue.pull_request &&
           startsWith(github.event.comment.body, '/orcarouter-review') &&
           contains(fromJSON('["OWNER", "MEMBER", "COLLABORATOR"]'), github.event.comment.author_association))
       steps:
         - uses: Continuum-AI-Corp/orcarouter-code-review/review-action@v1
           with:
             orcarouter-api-key: ${{ secrets.ORCAROUTER_API_KEY }}
   ```

3. Add a repository secret **`ORCAROUTER_API_KEY`** (Settings → Secrets and
   variables → Actions).

Open a PR — the review posts automatically. You never copy scripts or config;
bump the `@v1` tag to update.

## Configuration

All optional — pass as `with:` inputs on the action:

| Input | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `orcarouter-api-key` | _(required)_ | OrcaRouter API key |
| `orcarouter-url` | `https://api.orcarouter.ai/v1/chat/completions` | Gateway endpoint |
| `brand` | `OrcaRouter Code Review` | Name shown on PR comments |
| `router` | `orcarouter/code-review` | OrcaRouter router alias whose DSL recipe picks the cheap/strong model per tier (the action names no models) |
| `fix-first` | `P0,P1` | Keep the PR on the cheap tier until these are cleared (then it's promoted) |
| `block-on` | `P0` | Fail the check (block merge) on one of these |

## Severity rubric

| Tag | Meaning | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| **P0** | Blocker — must not merge | injection, XSS, `eval` on untrusted input, exposed secret, data loss, crash on a normal path, broken build |
| **P1** | High — fix before merge | null deref, unhandled async rejection, race condition, resource leak, missing boundary validation, wrong-result logic |
| **P2** | Advisory | dead code, duplication, naming, `any`, `==` vs `===`, `var`, nested ternaries, minor perf |

The rubric lives in `rules/severity-instruction.md` — edit it to retune what
counts as P0/P1/P2 for your codebase.

## Making it block merges

The gate only blocks if the check is **required**: Settings → Branches → branch
protection rule → "Require status checks to pass" → select **OrcaRouter Code
Review / review**.

## Try it locally (optional)

```bash
npm install -g @alibaba-group/open-code-review@1.3.13
ocr config set llm.url        https://api.orcarouter.ai/v1/chat/completions
ocr config set llm.auth_token <YOUR_ORCAROUTER_KEY>
ocr config set llm.auth_header authorization
ocr config set llm.model      orcarouter/code-review   # routes via your DSL recipe
ocr config set llm.use_anthropic false
ocr llm test                                    # connectivity check
ocr review --background "$(cat review-action/rules/severity-instruction.md)" --format json
```

## Notes

- The workflow uses `pull_request_target` so secrets are available on fork PRs.
  This is safe here because the engine only **reads** the diff and repo files —
  it never executes PR code. Don't add build/test steps that run untrusted code
  to this workflow.
- Server-side gateway guardrails (prompt-injection / PII filtering) and static
  security scanners (secrets / CVE / SBOM) are **out of scope** for this version
  and tracked as follow-ups.
